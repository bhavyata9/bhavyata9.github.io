        Hey Everyone! 
        I am a fourth year (3B term) Software Engineering student at the University of Waterloo 
        who is very passionate about programming, music, and exercising. <br/>


        For my last work term, I was working at <a class="resume-link" href="https://www.inkling.com" target="_blank">Inkling</a> where I worked with Java, Objective-C, and React 
        to develop the Content Alerts feature. <br/> <br/>

        My passion for programming and algorithms ignited when I was in highschool. Since then, through my work and study experiences 
        I've not only grown in a technical manner, but also developed a different mindset. I have learned that it is ok and important to make 
        mistakes to grow. I continually strive to take risks and try new pathways knowing that they may sometimes lead to a dead end. 
        <br> <br/>

        I'm actively looking for challenging and unique internship opportunities. View my <a class="resume-link" target="_blank" href="Bhavya Resume.pdf">resume</a>.
